## [4.12.7] — 2026-05-19

### Fixed
- **TAFFY harness permission mode**: TAFFY launches now run in permissive mode per harness where supported so orchestrated phases do not stall on interactive permission prompts. Claude uses `--dangerously-skip-permissions`, Copilot uses `--allow-all`, and Cursor uses `--yolo --sandbox disabled --approve-mcps`. Non-TAFFY launches are unchanged.
- **Implement-stories TAFFY handoff mode**: `maple req` implementation handoff now uses the same TAFFY permissive launch path for consistent runtime behavior across quick-launch and req flows.

## [4.10.2] — 2026-04-22

### Fixed
- **Cross-platform `rtk` install fallback**: the v4.10.1 fallback only covered linux/macos. Both `scripts/install.ps1` and `maple init` now also try `cargo install --git https://github.com/rtk-ai/rtk` when cargo is on PATH — rtk-ai's officially documented Windows install method, and a universal escape hatch when binary downloads are blocked (proxies, corp firewalls). `findInstalledRTK` is now Windows-aware, searching `%USERPROFILE%\.cargo\bin` on Windows vs. `~/.cargo/bin`, `~/.local/bin`, `/usr/local/bin` on Unix.

## [4.10.1] — 2026-04-22

### Added
- **Copilot sessions in the Agents pane**: `maple` now discovers GitHub Copilot CLI sessions from `~/.copilot/session-state/*`, filtering by matching `cwd` in each session's `workspace.yaml`. Shown with a `[gh]` badge alongside Claude (`[cc]`) and OpenCode (`[oc]`) rows. The session detail popup parses `events.jsonl` for user/assistant messages, tool calls, and model changes. `o` (open) and the `L` launcher resume Copilot sessions via `copilot --resume=<id>`. `maple resume-session copilot` works from the CLI.

### Fixed
- **`rtk` install fallback**: on linux/macos, if the GitHub release tarball approach fails (rate limit, unsupported arch, extraction error), both `scripts/install.sh` and `maple init` now fall back to piping the upstream install script — `curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rtk-ai/rtk/refs/heads/master/install.sh | sh`. After the upstream script exits, the Go installer searches `$PATH`, `~/.cargo/bin`, `~/.local/bin`, and `/usr/local/bin` for the resulting binary.

## [4.9.0] — 2026-04-21

### Changed
- **maple never exits for harness launches**: pressing `o` (open session), Enter in the superpower launch overlay, or Enter in the `L` launcher no longer calls `tea.Quit`. Spawning is now a `tea.Cmd` — if `spawnInNewTerminal` succeeds, a status message confirms it; if it fails, a manual-launch modal appears inside the TUI showing the command to paste, with `[c]` to copy to clipboard. maple stays alive in all cases.

### Added
- **Manual-launch modal**: when no new-terminal mechanism is detected (no tmux/zellij/WezTerm/Kitty, no GUI emulator), a centered overlay shows the exact command to paste in a new terminal window. Clipboard copy via `[c]` (pbcopy / xclip / xsel / clip depending on OS).

## [4.8.1] — 2026-04-21

### Fixed
- **Pipeline overlay live-updates**: `pipelineState` and `approvalPending` are now refreshed on every 5-second tick, so the `[P]` overlay shows current stage/status/approval without the user having to close and reopen it. The `[a]` approve button appears automatically when `approval-pending.txt` is written by the skill.

## [4.8.0] — 2026-04-21

### Added
- **New terminal spawning**: launching a harness (superpower overlay, `L` launcher, `o` open-session) now tries to open it in a new terminal tab/window so maple stays visible. Detection order: tmux → screen → WezTerm → Kitty → macOS iTerm2/Terminal.app → Linux (`x-terminal-emulator`, gnome-terminal, konsole, xterm) → Windows Terminal / cmd. Falls back to suspend-and-resume in the same terminal if none is found (SSH, headless, etc.).
- **`maple resume-session [harness]`**: resumes the project's pinned session from `.claude/state/sessions.json` directly from the CLI — no need to open the TUI. With no argument, prefers claude then opencode. Pass `claude` or `opencode` to target a specific harness.

## [4.7.2] — 2026-04-21

### Fixed
- **`o` key (open+pin session)**: now works for OpenCode sessions — `sessionUUID` was returning `""` for all non-Claude sources, so OpenCode sessions were never pinned and `opencode` was launched without a `--session` flag. Both are fixed.
- **`o` key feedback**: pressing `o` outside the Agents pane now shows a helpful status message instead of silently doing nothing.
- **`p` key pin confirmation**: status bar now shows "saved to .claude/state/sessions.json" so the user knows where to find it.
- **`opencode --session <id>` resume**: `agentOpenCmd` now passes `--session <id>` when opening an OpenCode session.

## [4.7.1] — 2026-04-21

### Fixed
- Launching a harness from the superpower overlay (or `L` launcher) no longer kills maple. The harness runs in the foreground of the same terminal; when it exits maple restarts the dashboard automatically. Works on all platforms and terminals — no new-tab/window APIs needed.

## [4.7.0] — 2026-04-21

### Changed
- **Superpower selection now launches directly**: pressing Enter on a superpower no longer exits and prints instructions. Instead it opens a launch overlay:
  - If a pinned session exists: goes straight to prompt input, showing the harness + session that will be resumed
  - If no pinned session: shows a harness picker first (Claude Code / OpenCode / Copilot), then prompt input
  - Optional context/prompt can be typed; Enter builds `<harness> [--resume <id>] "/superpower-runner <name> <context>"` and execs it

## [4.6.0] — 2026-04-21

### Added
- **RTK harness selector**: `R` key opens a multi-select overlay listing all supported harnesses (Claude Code/Copilot, Gemini CLI, Codex, Cursor, Windsurf, Cline/Roo Code, Kilo Code, Google Antigravity). Space toggles, Enter runs `rtk init` with the right flags for each. Already-installed harnesses shown as `✓`. State persisted to `.claude/state/rtk-harnesses.json`.

### Fixed
- **Stale pipeline**: P overlay now detects when a RUNNING pipeline hasn't been updated in >10 min (agent likely died). Shows grey "RUNNING (stale)" with a hint to press `[c]` to clear.
- **`[c]` key in P overlay**: deletes `maple.json` and `approval-pending.txt` so a dead pipeline doesn't block future runs.

## [4.5.0] — 2026-04-21

### Added
- **RTK token optimizer**: `install.sh` and `install.ps1` now auto-install `rtk` alongside `maple` for all platforms (mac/linux/windows). `maple init` runs `rtk init` to wire the `PreToolUse` hook. Boot check shows `rtk` status. Skip with `--skip-rtk`.
- **Session pinning**: TUI `p` key pins the selected agent session to `.claude/state/sessions.json`; `o` key auto-pins on open. `superpower-runner` reads pinned session IDs to resume work in the right context.
- **Launch dialog**: TUI `L` key opens a tool picker overlay — select Claude Code / OpenCode / Copilot, type a command, and launch it directly. Pinned sessions shown with ★.
- **File-based approval handoff**: at human-approval gates, `superpower-runner` writes `.claude/state/approval-pending.txt` and polls for its deletion. TUI `P` → `a` approves from the dashboard without switching to the agent terminal.
- **Shared state protocol**: `superpower-runner` SKILL.md (both `.claude/` and `.opencode/`) now documents all three shared state files (`maple.json`, `approval-pending.txt`, `sessions.json`) with owner columns so agents and TUI stay in sync.

### Fixed
- `install.ps1` had stale repo `kinncj/AI-Squad` — corrected to `kinncj/MAPLE`

## [4.4.2] — 2026-04-21

### Fixed
- `writeRecoveryMarker` now merges with existing `maple.json` instead of overwriting — TUI start/exit no longer wipes superpower pipeline state written by the `superpower-runner` skill, so the `P` pane shows the correct status

## [4.4.1] — 2026-04-21

### Fixed
- `install.sh` now finds the highest semver instead of using `/releases/latest` (which sorts by publish date, not version)
- Release fetch capped at `?per_page=100` — GitHub API max, single request
- Added `--version`/`-v` flag and `--install-dir` flag to `install.sh`

## [4.4.0] — 2026-04-21

- Removed stale PROBLEM/SPEC/TASKS references from orchestrator, architect, and spec-kit agents
- Story frontmatter schema unified across template, validator, and spec-kit skill
- `copilot-instructions.md` and `stories.instructions` synced to canonical frontmatter
- Design and a11y gates made phase-aware (skip before design is approved)
- Pipeline status overlay (`P` key) added to TUI — reads `.claude/state/maple.json`
- `qa-cucumber` agent added; ADR enforcement gate wired into orchestrator
- `product-owner` agent deduplicated; `api-endpoint` example added to agents docs
- Added 8 missing agents to `AGENTS.md` quick-reference table
